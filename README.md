# QEABoatModule
MATLAB code from Quantitative Engineering Analysis Module 1

In this project, my partner and I generated an appropriate surface equation for a boat hull and performed analysis using matlab to calculate the proper mast and ballast location so that the boat would have an angle of vanishing stability between 120 and 140 degrees. Below is a picture of my final boat, appropriatly named "hold on" after MATLAB :).
